                Hello, I’m Pedram Babazadeh — a passionate software engineer with a relentless drive to push technological boundaries. My journey began in 2018 as a frontend developer, where I honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, and Next.js. Over the years, I expanded my expertise to backend development with Python and Flask, diving deep into AI and machine learning with frameworks like PyTorch, NumPy, and Pandas.

                Fueled by curiosity and an insatiable appetite for learning, I’ve explored bioinformatics, NLP, and the intersection of AI with cutting-edge fields like cancer research and DNA editing. My ultimate goal is to contribute to revolutionary advancements in healthcare through AI-driven innovation.
              </p>
              <p>
                I thrive on solving complex problems, embracing challenges that demand both logic and creativity. My structured, strategic approach — balanced with out-of-the-box thinking — empowers me to turn ambitious ideas into reality.
              </p>
              <p>
                Currently, I’m preparing for a new chapter in Germany, where I’ll combine my academic pursuits in Software Engineering with hands-on industry experience. Whether building intelligent systems or refining my German to C1, I’m always evolving to reach the next frontier of discovery.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>My motto?</strong> "Either I find a way or I make one." Let’s connect and shape the future together!
