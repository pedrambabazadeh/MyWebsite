          As a junior front-end developer, I am passionate
about creating engaging and intuitive user
interfaces that improve the user experience. I
have experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
having developed several projects including
responsive websites and web applications. I have
also worked with popular frontend frameworks
and libraries such as React.js, jQuery, and
Bootstrap, and am eager to continue learning and
using new technologies. Collaborating with other
team members is a strength of mine, and I am
dedicated to writing clean and efficient code
that meets project requirements.
